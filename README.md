# IvyHacksProject
Project for the IvyHacks Hackathon  
Website under www/name.html  
  
To-Do List style website where users can log tasks to be done, and mark as completed as they finish. There is a reward system for completing tasks, where new images are unlocked for a "profile picture" as users complete more tasks.
